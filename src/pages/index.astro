                <h2>So who's basher?</h2>
                <p>I'm glad you asked. &ldquo;basher&rdquo; is an old school nickname that's pretty much stuck.
                For many years I was an aspiring rock star, thrashing my drums on sweaty stages for many bands, but mainly for UK rockers <a href="#rockstar">bushbaby</a>.<p>
                <p>As a sideline, I combined my artistic creativity &amp; background in computers by building websites for local bands,
                teaching myself the fundamentals of web design, and experiencing the joys of browser testing in Netscape!
                But I've left those &ldquo;hobbyist&rdquo; days behind me now&hellip; I've been a full-time front-end web developer since 2007.</p>
