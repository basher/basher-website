                    <h2>so who is &ldquo;basher&rdquo;?</h2>
                    <p>I'm glad you asked.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;basher&rdquo; is an old school nickname that's pretty much stuck.
                    For many years I was an aspiring rock star, thrashing my drums on sweaty stages for many bands, but mainly for UK rockers <a href="#rockstar">bushbaby</a>.<p>
                    <p>As a sideline, I combined my artistic creativity and background in computers by building websites for local bands,
                    teaching myself the fundamentals of web design, and experiencing the joys of browser testing in IE5 and Netscape!
                    But I've left those &ldquo;hobbyist&rdquo; days far behind me now&hellip; I've been a full-time front-end web developer since 2007.</p>

                    <h2>what I do</h2>
